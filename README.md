# Welcome to Svemix

Svemix is a somewhat different framework than you're probably used to.
It can be seen as an full-stack addition to Svelte(SvelteKit).
Svemix provides you with server scripts inside your Svelte components/routes, which will be transformed into endpoints.
Loader functions and actions similar to remix, which also run only on the server, improved developer experience, SEO handling, easy to use forms, sessions and so much more.

[For an still early example please look into this repo](https://github.com/svemix/svemix-example).
